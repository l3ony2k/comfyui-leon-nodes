## ComfyUI Leon API Nodes Development Log

This log documents the development and troubleshooting process for the custom API nodes in `leon_api_node.py`.

### Initial Goal: Add Multiple API-based Image Generation Nodes

- **Google Imagen Node**: Implement a node to interact with Google Imagen models via the HyprLab API.
- **Luma AI Node**: Implement a node for Luma AI (photon, photon-flash) via HyprLab API.
- **Midjourney Proxy Node**: Implement a node to interact with a self-hosted Midjourney proxy.

### Core Development Steps & Architectural Decisions

1.  **HyprLab API Base Class (`HyprLabImageGenerationNodeBase`):**
    *   Created to encapsulate common logic for nodes interacting with the HyprLab `/images/generations` endpoint.
    *   Handles API authentication, request formation (POST), response handling (b64_json and URL), image downloading, and conversion to an RGBA PyTorch tensor.
    *   Includes Tenacity for retry logic on API calls.
    *   Ensures output tensors are always 4-channel (RGBA) by explicitly adding an alpha channel if the source image is RGB. This addressed an early `RuntimeError` related to tensor dimension mismatches when interacting with downstream nodes expecting RGBA.

2.  **Google Imagen Node (`Leon_Google_Image_API_Node`):**
    *   Inherits from `HyprLabImageGenerationNodeBase`.
    *   Defines specific `INPUT_TYPES` for Google Imagen (prompt, model, aspect_ratio, output_format, seed, api_url, api_key, response_format).
    *   The `generate_image` method constructs the Google Imagen-specific payload and calls the base class's `_make_api_call`.

3.  **Luma AI Node (`Leon_Luma_AI_Image_API_Node`):**
    *   Inherits from `HyprLabImageGenerationNodeBase`.
    *   Defines `INPUT_TYPES` based on Luma AI documentation (prompt, model, output_format, seed, api_url, api_key, response_format, and optional parameters like aspect_ratio, image_reference_url, style_reference_url, etc.).
    *   The `generate_luma_image` method constructs the Luma AI-specific payload, adding optional parameters if provided, and calls `_make_api_call`.

4.  **Midjourney Proxy Node (`Leon_Midjourney_Proxy_API_Node`):**
    *   Implemented as a standalone class due to its different API interaction pattern (submit task, then poll for results).
    *   **Inputs**: Initially `mj_proxy_endpoint`, `prompt`, `bot_type`, etc. Refactored to include `mj_api_secret`, `x_api_key`, `account_filter_remark`, `base64_array_json` based on detailed API examples.
    *   **Outputs**: `image` (RGBA tensor), `image_url`, `task_id`. Refactored to add `final_prompt_from_api` and `message_hash`.
    *   **Logic**:
        *   Submits an `/mj/submit/imagine` request to the proxy using appropriate headers (`mj-api-secret`, `X-Api-Key`) and payload (`accountFilter`, `base64Array`).
        *   Polls the `/mj/task/{id}/fetch` endpoint for task status, ensuring headers are also sent for these calls.
        *   Handles `SUCCESS` (downloads image, converts to RGBA tensor) and `FAILURE` states.
        *   Extracts and returns `finalPrompt` and `messageHash` from the task data upon success.

5.  **Image Utility Node (`Leon_Image_Split_4Grid_Node`):**
    *   Created to split a 2x2 grid image into four separate image outputs (TL, TR, BL, BR).
    *   Input: Single image tensor.
    *   Outputs: Four image tensors.
    *   Placed in a new category: `Leon_Utils`.

6.  **String Utility Node (`Leon_String_Combine_Node`):**
    *   Created to combine two strings with a user-defined linking element.
    *   Inputs: `string_1`, `string_2`, `linking_element` (defaults to a space).
    *   Output: `combined_string`.
    *   Placed in a new category: `Leon_Utils`.

7.  **FLUX Image API Node (`Leon_Flux_Image_API_Node`):**
    *   Inherits from `HyprLabImageGenerationNodeBase`.
    *   Supports multiple FLUX model variants (`FLUX 1.1 Pro Ultra`, `FLUX 1.1 Pro`, `FLUX Pro Canny`, `FLUX Dev`, `FLUX Schnell`) via HyprLab, based on [HyprLab Black Forest Labs Docs](https://docs.hyprlab.io/browse-models/model-list/black-forest-labs).
    *   Default model set to `FLUX 1.1 Pro`.
    *   **Inputs**: `model_choice`, `prompt`, `response_format`, `output_format`, `seed`, `api_url`, `api_key`, and optional model-specific parameters (`image_prompt`, `image_prompt_strength`, `aspect_ratio`, `raw`, `steps`, `height`, `width`) with tooltips indicating applicability.
    *   Dynamically constructs the API payload based on the selected FLUX model variant, mapping display names to specific API model strings (e.g., `flux-1.1-pro-ultra`, `flux-1.1-pro`, `flux-pro-canny`, `flux-dev`, `flux-schnell`).
    *   `FLUX Pro Canny` assumes similar parameters to `FLUX 1.1 Pro` (including `image_prompt`, `steps`, `height`, `width`).
    *   Includes validation for `height` and `width` (must be multiples of 32) for relevant models.
    *   Placed in the `Leon_API` category.

8.  **Node Registration & `__init__.py`:**
    *   All nodes are registered in `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` and `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS` at the end of `leon_api_node.py`.
    *   **Crucially**, these mappings must also be correctly updated in the project's root `__init__.py` file for ComfyUI to discover all nodes, especially after adding new ones like the image split, string combine, and FLUX nodes. Failure to do so was a cause for new nodes not appearing.

### Troubleshooting: Nodes Not Appearing in ComfyUI

**Symptom**: After adding new nodes, they were sometimes not visible in ComfyUI.

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**

1.  **Standard Checks**: Hard browser refresh, checking ComfyUI console errors, deleting `__pycache__` folders (in the node directory, custom_nodes directory, and even the main ComfyUI directory).
2.  **Node Definition Review**: Ensuring `CATEGORY`, `RETURN_TYPES`, `RETURN_NAMES`, `FUNCTION`, and `INPUT_TYPES` were explicitly and correctly defined in each node class.
3.  **`__init__.py` Verification**: **This was a key recurring point.** Ensuring that `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` and `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS` in the main `__init__.py` of the custom node package were updated with *every* new node. Importing with `from .leon_api_node import *` is not enough; the mappings need to be explicitly maintained in `__init__.py` as well for ComfyUI's loader.

**Outcome of Troubleshooting**: Consistent application of cache clearing and meticulous updates to both `leon_api_node.py` mappings and `__init__.py` mappings resolved visibility issues.

### Bug Fixes During Development

*   **`TypeError` in `Leon_Luma_AI_Image_API_Node`**: Corrected an issue where the default `aspect_ratio` was being accessed incorrectly from the `INPUT_TYPES` tuple. The access method `self.INPUT_TYPES()["optional"]["aspect_ratio"]["default"]` was changed to `self.INPUT_TYPES()["optional"]["aspect_ratio"][1]["default"]` to correctly index the dictionary within the tuple.
*   **Luma AI Node Payload Omission**: Fixed an issue in `Leon_Luma_AI_Image_API_Node` where the `aspect_ratio` was not being added to the API request payload if its value was the same as the default. The logic was changed to always include the `aspect_ratio` from the UI in the payload.

### Key Takeaways for Future Development

*   **`__init__.py` is CRITICAL**: For custom node packages, `__init__.py` is not just for imports. ComfyUI relies on its `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` and `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS` to discover nodes. *Always update it when adding or renaming nodes.*
*   **Cache Clearing**: Aggressively clear `__pycache__` (in multiple relevant locations) and browser cache when nodes don't appear or update.
*   **Explicit Node Attributes**: Be explicit with node registration attributes in each class.
*   **Console Logging**: Use `print()` statements in your node file during development (e.g., at import time, before class definitions, in `__init__` methods of nodes) to trace execution if ComfyUI has trouble loading them. Check the ComfyUI console.
*   **Clear `__pycache__`**: This is often a first-line fix for custom node update issues in ComfyUI.
*   **Explicit Node Attributes**: For node registration attributes (`CATEGORY`, `RETURN_TYPES`, `RETURN_NAMES`, `FUNCTION`, `INPUT_TYPES`), while inheritance is a good Python practice, being explicit in each node class can prevent subtle loading issues with ComfyUI.
*   **Console Errors are Gold**: Always check the ComfyUI startup console for Python errors. They often point directly to the problematic code in a custom node file.
*   **Iterative Testing**: When adding multiple nodes or complex features, test frequently to catch integration issues early.
*   **Base Classes for Common Logic**: Using base classes (like `HyprLabImageGenerationNodeBase`) is effective for keeping code DRY when multiple nodes share significant functionality (e.g., interacting with the same API provider under a common path).

9.  **ImgBB Upload Utility Node (`Leon_ImgBB_Upload_Node`):**
    *   Created to upload images to ImgBB.
    *   Inputs: `image` (tensor), `api_key` (string), `expire` (boolean, optional), `expiration_time_seconds` (int, optional).
    *   Output: `image_url` (string).
    *   Converts tensor to PIL, saves as PNG to buffer, base64 encodes, and posts to ImgBB API.
    *   Handles API key validation, expiration parameter, and error responses.
    *   Placed in the `Leon_Utils` category.
    *   Added to `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` and `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS` in both `leon_api_node.py` and the root `__init__.py`.
