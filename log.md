## ComfyUI Leon API Nodes Development Log

This log documents the development and troubleshooting process for the custom API nodes in `leon_api_node.py`.

### Initial Goal: Add Multiple API-based Image Generation Nodes

- **Google Imagen Node**: Implement a node to interact with Google Imagen models via the HyprLab API.
- **Luma AI Node**: Implement a node for Luma AI (photon, photon-flash) via HyprLab API.
- **Midjourney Proxy Node**: Implement a node to interact with a self-hosted Midjourney proxy.

### Core Development Steps & Architectural Decisions

1.  **HyprLab API Base Class (`HyprLabImageGenerationNodeBase`):**
    *   Created to encapsulate common logic for nodes interacting with the HyprLab `/images/generations` endpoint.
    *   Handles API authentication, request formation (POST), response handling (b64_json and URL), image downloading, and conversion to an RGBA PyTorch tensor.
    *   Includes Tenacity for retry logic on API calls.
    *   Ensures output tensors are always 4-channel (RGBA) by explicitly adding an alpha channel if the source image is RGB. This addressed an early `RuntimeError` related to tensor dimension mismatches when interacting with downstream nodes expecting RGBA.

2.  **Google Imagen Node (`Leon_Google_Image_API_Node`):**
    *   Inherits from `HyprLabImageGenerationNodeBase`.
    *   Defines specific `INPUT_TYPES` for Google Imagen (prompt, model, aspect_ratio, output_format, seed, api_url, api_key, response_format).
    *   The `generate_image` method constructs the Google Imagen-specific payload and calls the base class's `_make_api_call`.

3.  **Luma AI Node (`Leon_Luma_AI_Image_API_Node`):**
    *   Inherits from `HyprLabImageGenerationNodeBase`.
    *   Defines `INPUT_TYPES` based on Luma AI documentation (prompt, model, output_format, seed, api_url, api_key, response_format, and optional parameters like aspect_ratio, image_reference_url, style_reference_url, etc.).
    *   The `generate_luma_image` method constructs the Luma AI-specific payload, adding optional parameters if provided, and calls `_make_api_call`.

4.  **Midjourney Proxy Node (`Leon_Midjourney_Proxy_API_Node`):**
    *   Implemented as a standalone class due to its different API interaction pattern (submit task, then poll for results).
    *   **Inputs**: `mj_proxy_endpoint`, `prompt`, `bot_type`, `polling_interval_seconds`, `max_polling_attempts`, optional `ref_image_base64`, optional `notify_hook`.
    *   **Outputs**: `image` (RGBA tensor), `image_url`, `task_id`.
    *   **Logic**:
        *   Submits an `/mj/submit/imagine` request to the proxy.
        *   Handles `base64Array` for reference images, formatting raw base64 strings into data URIs.
        *   Polls the `/mj/task/{id}/fetch` endpoint for task status.
        *   Handles `SUCCESS` (downloads image, converts to RGBA tensor) and `FAILURE` states.
        *   Raises an error if the task enters a `MODAL` state, as this node is not designed for modal interactions.
        *   Includes a timeout mechanism for polling.
    *   Uses a local helper `_pil_to_rgba_tensor` for image processing.

5.  **Node Registration:**
    *   All nodes are registered in `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` and `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS` at the end of `leon_api_node.py` for ComfyUI to discover them.

### Troubleshooting: Nodes Not Appearing in ComfyUI

**Symptom**: After adding new nodes (`Leon_Luma_AI_Image_API_Node`, `Leon_Midjourney_Proxy_API_Node`), only the original `Leon_Google_Image_API_Node` was visible in the ComfyUI interface despite restarts and browser refreshes.

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken (and learned lessons):**

1.  **Standard Checks (Initial thoughts - always good to re-verify):**
    *   **Hard Browser Refresh**: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R`) to clear browser cache. (Tried)
    *   **ComfyUI Console Errors**: Checked the terminal output when ComfyUI starts for any Python errors during node loading. (Advised)
    *   **`__pycache__` Deletion**: Python bytecode caching can sometimes serve stale versions. Deleting `__pycache__` in the custom node directory and restarting ComfyUI is a crucial step. (Advised & Performed by user)
    *   **File Location**: Confirmed `leon_api_node.py` was in the correct `custom_nodes` subdirectory. (Implicitly confirmed)
    *   **Node Mapping Correctness**: Double-checked `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` and `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS` for typos or omissions. (Initially okay, but reviewed)

2.  **Deep Dive into Node Definitions (When standard checks weren't enough):**
    *   **Problem Hypothesis**: If ComfyUI successfully loads the file but fails to register specific classes as nodes, it might be due to issues within the class definitions themselves, how they are structured, or how ComfyUI's loader interprets them (especially with inheritance).
    *   **Solution Attempted & Successful**: Explicitly defining `CATEGORY`, `RETURN_TYPES`, `RETURN_NAMES`, and `FUNCTION` class attributes within *each* derived node class (`Leon_Google_Image_API_Node`, `Leon_Luma_AI_Image_API_Node`) instead of relying solely on inheritance from `HyprLabImageGenerationNodeBase`.
        *   **Reasoning**: While inheritance *should* work, making these critical registration attributes explicit in each node class can improve robustness for ComfyUI's loader, removing ambiguity.
    *   **Simplified Optional Parameter Handling**: In `Leon_Luma_AI_Image_API_Node`, the logic for constructing the payload with optional parameters was slightly simplified to directly check the provided arguments. This was a minor refinement, likely not the primary cause of the visibility issue but good for clarity.

**Outcome of Troubleshooting**: After explicitly defining the class attributes in the derived nodes and ensuring `__pycache__` was cleared, all nodes appeared correctly in ComfyUI.

### Key Takeaways for Future Development

*   **Clear `__pycache__`**: This is often a first-line fix for custom node update issues in ComfyUI.
*   **Explicit Node Attributes**: For node registration attributes (`CATEGORY`, `RETURN_TYPES`, `RETURN_NAMES`, `FUNCTION`, `INPUT_TYPES`), while inheritance is a good Python practice, being explicit in each node class can prevent subtle loading issues with ComfyUI.
*   **Console Errors are Gold**: Always check the ComfyUI startup console for Python errors. They often point directly to the problematic code in a custom node file.
*   **Iterative Testing**: When adding multiple nodes or complex features, test frequently to catch integration issues early.
*   **Base Classes for Common Logic**: Using base classes (like `HyprLabImageGenerationNodeBase`) is effective for keeping code DRY when multiple nodes share significant functionality (e.g., interacting with the same API provider under a common path).
